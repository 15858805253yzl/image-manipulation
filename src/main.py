"""
Design Criteria:
- As seen from the figure, the interface must include two parts: One for source and the other for output.
- The functionalities must be collected under five menus: File, Edit, Conversion, 
Segmentation, and Edge Detection. Also, each functionality must have a button.
- You can use toolbar or group boxes for that purpose.
- Each functionality must have an appropriate shortcut, status bar tip, and icon. 
- Do not use default object names that are given in Qt Designer. Each object in the interface must have an appropriate and unique name.
